This is an application which uses facebook graph api to fetch facebook name and profile picture of the user.
You just have to enter facebook username in the text field and click on GO button and then see the magic.
Now your facebook username is the one which appears on your profile link. Go to your PROFILE on facebook and then check the url. url structure is somewhat this 
				www.facebook.com/FacebookUsername
and there is your facebook username.... :D

This application is coded in Ember.js because i love the way ember sings... :D :D

I hosted this app on  http://minifb.comuv.com/   ... check it out.. :D :D
